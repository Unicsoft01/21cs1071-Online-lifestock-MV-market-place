Livestock trading is a critical component of the agricultural economy,
particularly in regions where livestock farming is a primary source of income.
Traditionally, this trade has relied heavily on physical marketplaces where
buyers and sellers meet in person to negotiate prices and finalize

adopt these digital innovations. The lack of specialized platforms tailored to
the unique needs of livestock trading has been a major barrier to the digital
transformation of this sector Nakamura &amp; Nkamnebe, (2021).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
